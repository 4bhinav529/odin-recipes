    <li>
        Wash the chicken thoroughly and prick all over so that it can absorb the marinade well. If you’re using chicken pieces, then put them in a zip lock bag and pound gently using a kitchen mallet or rolling pin to flatten and tenderize them.

        Add all the ingredients listed under the first marinade section in a large bowl. Mix and coat the chicken well and set aside for 30 minutes. In a pan, dry-roast the special spice mix for about a minute or until the spices release their aroma. Grind them into a fine powder and set aside.

        In the same pan, dry-roast dried fenugreek for about 30 seconds and set it aside. Mix the ingredients listed under the second marinade section in another bowl, including the roasted fenugreek by crushing it with your hands. Also, add the blended special spice mix. After 30 minutes of the first marinade, pour and rub the second marinade on the chicken. Set aside for a minimum of 3 hours.
        
    </li>
    <li>
        Grill the chicken over charcoal barbecue until all sides are slightly charred and cooked. It can take about 15-20 minutes. Once the chicken is done, brush melted butter over it.
